BPlusTree: B+ Tree (in memory)
project for dasebase class, June 2013
Author : Ryan
============================================
5 files included:
main.c
	1. for test, see MainLoop(), xxx_test(), etc
	2. read data
	3. modify records on original record file so that you can check the changs
BPlusTree.h, BPlusTree.c
	Implement the B+ tree, node definitions, interfaces and some operations
Makefile
	using gcc to compiler the program
gen.py
	generate data for tests
============================================
on our test, the record format is (key, value) : (int, char*),
which also is the same as format of leaves
============================================
the B+ Tree is all in memory, so the order of tree won't be very large
for data set of 10^7 records, an order of not bigger than 100 is more effcient.
============================================
